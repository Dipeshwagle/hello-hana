description: After one year on Shopify, Graphic T-shirt shop Mama Bird & Co. found that its customers were confused about product availability. This project involved a complete overhaul of 400+ product listings to allow for better organization for both the back and front end. Upgrading to a new theme with color swatches and larger imagery allowed for clarity of product options, and an aesthetic better suited for fashion brands. The website got great feedback from wholesale buyers who could browse the website with a much clearer understanding of product options.
