title: Telephone Explosion Records
categories: ["Shopify","Music"]
description: This project was a modern and bold refresh to TER's website. I focused on connecting customers to the music. By embedding music players, adding digital downloads, and allowing for easier discovery of the catalog, customers can have an immersive shopping experience. This project involved building several custom sections and page layouts.
