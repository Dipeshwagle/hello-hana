description: Brushd offers zero-waste oral care products. This website was designed by the team at <a href="https://www.pimprestondesigns.com/" target="_blank">Pim Preston Designs</a>, and built by myself. Some unique elements of this website include the curves, gradients and “sticker” graphics you’ll find on every page. For example, hovering over the navigation items will show you a fun, squiggly underline. The page footer has a curved shape, and clean gradient background. The product pages have a “we’re eco-friendly” sticker over the product image, as well as icons highlighting the product features with more curvy section borders and gradient backgrounds. The integration of a subscription option was perfect for an oral care product. This fun and professional design made the website truly enjoyable to build.
