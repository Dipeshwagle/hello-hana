description: Luna Templates offers Shopify templates and educational resources for web designers who want to work on Shopify. This website and business is a collaboration between myself and <a href="https://www.chloeford.co.uk/" target="_blank">Chloe Ford</a>. Custom sections are used throughout the website including the impressive hero image that has text in the shape of a wave that moves as you scroll down the page. These custom sections show that designs on Shopify are truly limitless, with the right developer. This website involved integration of the Teachable learning platform, showing the diverse uses of Shopify.
