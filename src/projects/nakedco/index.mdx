categories: ["Shopify","Beauty"]
description: NakedCo is a beauty brand that embraces natural beauty. With the beauty space being incredibly competitive, a website establishing a strong brand identity was required. This website was designed by <a href="https://jocrossley.co.uk/" target="_blank">Jo Crossley</a>, and built by myself. Some highlights of this website were the scrolling press logos, customer testimonials showing real results of using the product, and clear communication of what makes this product special through icons. By offering subscriptions and discounted bundles, the brand has the opportunity to increase average order value and create long-lasting customer relationships.<br/><br/>Launching soon. Imagery to come!
