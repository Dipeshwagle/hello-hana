description: Smirk Stuff offers accessories that give back to the causes that people care about most. As this is a product that most people arenâ€™t familiar with, it was important to keep product imagery high on the page to clarify the product offering. I also highlighted the charitable aspect of the business by keeping a product/charity highlight on the home page, and adding a charity summary on each product page to show what cause the product supports. Some fun design elements were used such as custom animated buttons, wavy section borders, and a fun shaped discount pop-up to keep everything on-brand and visually interesting.
